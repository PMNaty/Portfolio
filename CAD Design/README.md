### CAD Design

**Parametric Modelling**
  - Creating 3D models driven by parameters and constraints, allowing easy updates and design iterations by modifying dimensional inputs.

**Synchronous Modelling**
  - A hybrid modelling approach combining direct editing and parametric control, enabling fast, flexible geometry manipulation without losing design intent.

**Assemblies**
  - Building complete products by organizing and constraining multiple individual components to define fit, motion, and interaction between parts.

**Sheet Metal**
  - Designing flat patterns and bent parts with manufacturing considerations such as bend reliefs and unfolding for laser or CNC cutting.

**Wire Harness and Cabling**
  - Routing and organizing electrical cables within a 3D assembly, including connectors, bundling, and defining lengths for accurate harness manufacturing.

**Surfacing**
  - Creating complex and freeform geometry using NURBS or surface patches, typically used for ergonomic shapes or aesthetic product design.

**Part Machining** *(Manual, Not CAM)*
  - Designing parts with clear consideration of manual subtractive manufacturing processes (e.g., turning, milling, drilling). Features are intentionally ordered and oriented based on practical machining sequences, ensuring that each step is manufacturable with conventional shop tools.

**Layouting**
  - Organizing and aligning components within an assembly or workspace, often involving planning for space, movement, or function within constraints.

**Drafting**
  - Producing 2D technical drawings from 3D models, complete with dimensions, tolerances, views, and annotations for manufacturing and documentation.

**Mesh Modelling**
  - Working with polygonal geometry, useful for 3D printing, rapid prototyping, reverse engineering, or importing from scanned or artistic models.
  
**Basic Sculpting**
  - Using digital clay-style tools to push, pull, and shape organic forms. Ideal for roughing out industrial designs or conceptual models.

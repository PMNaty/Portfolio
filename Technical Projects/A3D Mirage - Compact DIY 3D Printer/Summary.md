<img src="./.docs/images/Mirage_Enclosed.jpg" alt="Mirage Enclosed" width="390"/>

A compact DIY 3D printer built for versatility, portability, and performance.
Fast print speeds and setup times make it an excellent backup printer for small parts, and ideal for on-the-go demos and presentations.
Powered by Klipper firmware, the printer can be fully operated from any device with a web browser, as long as it's connected on the same network.

This is a personal project based on the Voron 0.2 by VoronDesign, with several custom modifications to enhance usability and performance.

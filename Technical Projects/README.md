## Compact DIY 3D Printer *"Mirage"* (2025)(On-going)

<img src=".docs/images/Mirage_Enclosed.jpg" alt="Mirage Enclosed" width="390"/>

A compact DIY 3D printer built for versatility, portability, and performance.
Fast print speeds and setup times make it an excellent backup printer for small parts, and ideal for on-the-go demos and presentations.
Powered by Klipper firmware, the printer can be fully operated from any device with a web browser, as long as it's connected on the same network.

</div>

A neurotech project under EDA-IBEHT in collaboration with DOST-PCHRD. Utilizes EEG and virtual reality technologies to support depression therapy by analyzing EEG signals within an immersive virtual environment.
#### Role: Prototype and VR Development

- Design, development, and assembly of the prototype structure. 
- Parts fabrication by operating multiple FDM 3D printers.
- Assist main VR developer in creating necessary scripts for the Unity project.
- Designed and layout using CAD: **Blender**
- Developed scripts using: **Python** and **C#**

## Unpublished toolhead for 3D printer Kingroon KP3S 3.0 (2024)

<img src=".docs/images/KP3S_DB.png" alt="KP3S Toolhead" width="390"/>

A retrofitted toolhead into the commercial 3D printer by Kingroon KP3S 3.0 Offers improved part cooling, enabling faster print speeds, automatic bed leveling and the ability to print non-exotic, high temperature materials (ABS and ASA) compared to stock toolhead.

- Current design is not optimized and is for personal use only. It was needed immediately to print **ABS** parts.
- Designed and layout using CAD: **NX Siemens**

#### **Design highlights** :
  - Used the original mounting plate, extruder, X homing switch and wire harness
  - BLTouch bed levelling probe
  - TZ-V6 2.0 all metal hotend
  - Dual 4010 fans for part cooling
  - Robust assembly and hidden wires
  - Everything was bolted with nuts for assembly</span> (I didn't have threaded inserts on hand)

#### Role: Sub Team Lead / Design Engineer

- Managed and coordinated the Filipino engineering team in the design work of a prototype autonomous forklift,
ensuring alignment and efficient collaboration with the Japanese parent team. 
- Designed new forklift components focused on sensor integration for vehicle autonomy and telemetry using **Creo PTC** and **NX Siemens**, handling the full design lifecycle including conceptualization, layout, modeling, drafting,
documentation, and design data management.
- Carried out design work for brackets, covers, sheet metal, welded, and machined components, wire harnesses, and
modification of existing parts to integrate sensors according to task specifications.
- Practiced reverse engineering, advanced parametric & rapid prototype modelling, GD&T analysis, simple static NX
FEA, reading electrical schematic & wiring diagrams, creating assembly guides, BOM creation, and processing ECNs.

## Eco Car *"Hiraya"* (2019)
<img src=".docs/images/Hiraya_No_Background.jpg" alt="Hiraya" width="390"/>

A four-wheeled prototype eco vehicle running on diesel engine. Represented DLSU-D in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2019 under the "Urban Concept - ICE" category. 
#### Role: Lead Mechanical Design

- Design and layout of the entire vehicle but mainly focused on the frame, chassis, steering mechanism and covers.
- Aluminum parts fabrication by operating CNC mills as well as manual milling machines and lathes. Exterior covers are made of composite fiber glass material, sheet metal, and clear polycarbonate sheets.
- Designed and layout using CAD: **Solidworks**

## Eco Car *"Agimat V2.0"* (2018)
<img src=".docs/images/Agimat_No_Background.jpg" alt="Agimat" width="390"/>

A three-wheeled prototype eco vehicle running on a lithium-ion battery Represented DLSU-D in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2018 under the "Prototype - Battery 
Electric" category, securing 15th place based on fuel efficiency among numerous participating teams.
#### Role: Mechanical Design

- Redesign and layout of the frontal structure, which includes: steering, front suspension, wheels, brakes, structural weight reduction, overall assembly, and other minor components.
- Aluminum parts fabrication by operating CNC mills as well as manual milling machines and lathes.
- Designed and layout using CAD: **Solidworks**

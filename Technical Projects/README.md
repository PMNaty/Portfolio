- A retrofitted toolhead into the commercial 3D printer by Kingroon KP3S 3.0
- Offers improved part cooling, enabling faster print speeds and the ability to print non-exotic, high temperature materials (ABS and ASA).
- The design highlights:
  - Used the original mounting plate, extruder, X homing switch and wire harness
  - Has a BLTouch bed levelling probe
  - Has an all metal hotend
  - Dual 4010 fans for part cooling
  - Robust assembly and hidden wires
  - <span style="color:#8B0000">Everything was bolted with nuts for assembly</span> (I didn't have threaded inserts on hand)
- Current design is not optimized and is for personal use only. It was needed immediately to print **ABS** parts.
- Designed in CAD: **NX Siemens**

## Eco Car *"Hiraya"* (2019)
<img src=".docs/images/Hiraya_No_Background.jpg" alt="Hiraya" width="200" style="margin-left: 96px;" />

- A four-wheeled prototype eco vehicle running on diesel engine.
- Represented DLSU-D in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2018 under the "Urban Concept - ICE" category. 
#### Role: Lead Mechanical Design

- Design and layout of the entire vehicle but mainly focused on the frame, chassis, steering mechanism and covers.
- Parts fabrication by operating CNC mills as well as manual milling machines and lathes.
- Designed in CAD: **Solidworks**

## Eco Car *"Agimat V2.0"* (2018)
<img src=".docs/images/Agimat_No_Background.jpg" alt="Agimat" width="200" style="margin-left: 96px;" />

- A three-wheeled prototype eco vehicle running on a lithium-ion battery
- Represented DLSU-D in the Shell Eco-Marathon Asia 2018 under the "Prototype - Battery 
Electric" category, securing 15th place based on fuel efficiency among numerous participating teams.
#### Role: Mechanical Design

- Redesign and layout of the frontal structure, which includes: steering, front suspension, wheels, brakes, structural weight reduction, overall assembly, and other minor components.
- Parts fabrication by operating CNC mills as well as manual milling machines and lathes.
- Designed in CAD: **Solidworks**
